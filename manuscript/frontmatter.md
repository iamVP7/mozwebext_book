# Acknowledgments

I would like to thank my parents first without whom I might have not been able to achieve anything in this world.

Second I would like to thank my friends and family members who supported me throughout this journey.

Special thanks to Amy and Caitlin from AMO team at Mozilla who supports contributors, encourages and motivate us to learn many things and contribute back to the community. I am very proud to say without their help it might have been difficult to stick with the community.

I also would like to thank Trishul, Santhosh, and Karthic the rockstar contributors who helped all these days and was together as a team to build community in India. Without these guys, learning won't be that much fun.

# Who should read this book

This book is targeted mainly for fresh developers who have a basic understanding of HTML, CSS, and Javascript or developers who would like to get started with developing browser extensions. With this book, you will learn how to build simple extensions using tab manipulation. My strict advice is to learn a bit of Javascript so using this book will be easier. In the future, I am targeting another book which will be targeted towards a wider audience and we will be learning more. 

# About Browser Extensions
This book totally consists of seven experiments. Each experiment is individual extension which can be used separately in your browser.  
 A browser extension (or "add-on") is code that can add features or functionality to Firefox.  It can be plugged at any time and can be removed if not required. Extensions for Firefox are written using the WebExtensions API, which to a large extent are supported across different browsers like Mozilla Firefox, Google Chrome, Opera Browser, and Microsoft Edge. 

# How is this book organised

The first two chapters **Getting Started with the WebExtensions API** and **Running Extensions in Firefox** will help you learn about the basics of browser extensions and teach you how to configure your browser for developing the extension and how to run them locally.

In *Experiment 1*, you will learn how to create very basic simple extension without much need of Javascript. If you are learning JS for the first time, you can work on this experiment.

In *Experiment 2*, we will be getting started with the first user interface (UI) with related to browser extensions. We will be getthe search engines in our browser and create a context menu and do the interaction with them. Context menus are most used UI in the browser by average users.

In *Experiment 3*, we will learn about the second type of user interface for extensions.  We will learn about browserAction, pop-up HTML pages, and interactions between the page and background script.

In *Experiment 4*, we will learn about the third type of user interface for xtensions.  We will learn about page actions and their interactions between the page and background script. This is similar to browserAction but with minimal difference.

In *Experiment 5*, we will be learning about notifications in extensions. This is one of the most interesting experiment and is my favorite one. This is very easy and most enjoyable experiment among all.

In *Experiment 6*, we will be learning how to build our own shortcuts using WebExtension API which works inside the browser. All the experiment before this we used to have some sort of visible user interface which can be displayed, but in this experiment, we will be doing everything in the background.

In *Experiment 7*,  this is the final experiment in this book. We will be learning how to interact with the address bar of the browser extension.

The real journey starts at the end of these 7 experiments. These experiments will be more like the stepping stones of our extenension development.
