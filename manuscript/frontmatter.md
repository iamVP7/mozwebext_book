# Acknowledgments

I would like to thank my parents first without whom I might have not been able to achieve anything in this world.

Second I would like to thank my friends and family members who supported me throughout this journey.

Special thanks to Amy and Caitlin from AMO team at Mozilla who supports contributors, encourages and motivate us to learn many things and contribute back to the community. I am very proud to say without their help it might have been difficult to stick with the community.

I also would like to thank Trishul, Santhosh, and Karthic the rockstar contributors who helped all these days and was together as a team to build community in India. Without these guys, learning won't be that much fun.

# Who should read this book

This book is targeted mainly for fresh developers who have a basic understanding of HTML, CSS, and Javascript or developers who would like to get started with WebExtension Development. With this book, you can easily get started to building simple WebExtension using Tab manipulation. My strict advice is to learn a bit of Javascript so using this book will be easier. In the future, I am targeting another book which will be targeted towards a wider audience and we will be learning more. Before starting that book, its good to learn this book first.

# How is this book organised

This book totally consists of seven experiments. Each experiment is individual WebExtension which can be used separately in your browser.  

Throughout this book Browser Extension or WebExtension or Add-ons means the same. BrowserExtension is the piece of software which will enhance our browsing experience. It can be plugged at any time and can be removed if not required.

The First two chapters **Getting Started with Mozilla WebExtensions** and **Running WebExtension in Firefox** will help you to get started with what is Browser Extension, how to configure your browser for developing the extension and how to run them locally.

- In *Experiment 1*, you will be learning how to create very basic simple extension without much need of Javascript. If you are learning JS for the first time, even then you can work on this experiment.

- In *Experiment 2*, we will be getting started with the first user interface (UI) with related to Browser Extension. We will be getting the search engines in our browser and create a context menu and do the interaction with them. Context menus are most used UI in the browser by average users.

- In *Experiment 3*, we will be learning about the second type of user interface of Browser Extension.  We will be learning about browser Action icon, pop-up HTML page, and interaction between the page and background script.

- In *Experiment 4*, we will be learning about the third type of user interface of Browser Extension.  We will be learning about page Action icon and its interaction between the page and background script. This is similar to browserAction but with minimal difference.

- In *Experiment 5*, we will be learning about the notifications in BrowserExtension.   This is one of the most interesting experiment and is my favorite one. This is very easy and most enjoyable experiment among all.

- In *Experiment 6*, we will be learning about the shortcuts in browser interacting via BrowserExtension.   All the experiment before this we used to have some sort of things which can be displayed, but in this experiment, we will be doing everything in the background.

- In *Experiment 7*,  this is the final experiment in this book. Here we will be learning about much simpler Extension development. We will be learning how to interact with the address bar of the browser extension.

The real journey starts at the end of this 7 experiments. These experiments will be more like the stepping stones of our WebExtenension development.
